    "## The Extraordinary Power of Explanatory Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of multiple linear regression lies in its ability to provide straightforward and interpretable solutions that not only predict future outcomes, but also provide insight into the underlying processes that create these outcomes.  For example, after fitting the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$HourlyWidgetProduction = \\alpha + \\beta_1WorkerAgeFrom18+ \\beta_2WorkerYearsinJob + \\beta_3IsRoundWidget$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we get these parameters:\n",
    "$$\\alpha = 2$$\n",
    "$$\\beta_1 = .1$$\n",
    "$$\\beta_2 = .2$$\n",
    "$$\\beta_3 = 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using those parameters, we learn that round widgets are twice as fast to produce as non-round widgets. We can tell because $\\alpha$ represents the intercept, the hourly rate of production for widgets that are not round (2 an hour) and $\\beta_3$ represents the difference between the intercept and the hourly rate of production for round widgets (also 2 an hour, for a total of 4 round widgets an hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learn that for every year a worker ages after the age of 18, their hourly production-rate goes up by .1 ($\\beta_1$).  In addition, for every year a worker has been in that job, their hourly production-rate goes up by .2 ($\\beta_2$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, using this model, we can predict that a 20-year-old worker who has been in the job for a year and is making only round widgets will make $2 + .1*2 + .2*1 + 4 = 6.3$ round widgets an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and probably of greatest interest, we get an **R-Squared** value.  This is a proportion (between 0 and 1) that expresses how much variance in the outcome variable our model was able to explain.  Higher $R^2$ values are better to a point-- a low $R^2$ indicates that our model isn't explaining much information about the outcome, which means it will not give very good predictions.  However, a very high $R^2$ is a warning sign for overfitting.  No dataset is a perfect representation of reality, so a model that perfectly fits our data ($R^2$ of 1 or close to 1) is likely to be biased by quirks in the data, and will perform less well on the test-set.\n",
