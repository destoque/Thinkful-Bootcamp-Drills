      "(Donald Black, John Barry) Diamonds are forever, They are all I need to please me, They can stimulate and tease me, They won't leave in the night, I've no fear that they might desert me. Diamonds are forever, Hold one up and then caress it, Touch it, stroke it and undress it, I can see ev'ry part, Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me. I don't need love, For what good will love do me? Diamonds never lie to me, For when love's gone, They'll lustre on. Diamonds are forever, Sparkling round my little finger.

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love, There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'. Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled, From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again, It only brings me sorrow. The same thing I want from you today, I would want again tomorrow. I got a letter on a lonesome day, It was from her ship a-sailin', Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again, It depends on how I'm a-feelin'. Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way, I'm sure your mind is roamin'. I'm sure your heart is not with me, But with the country to where you're goin'.

      "In a cavern, in a canyon, Excavating for a mine Dwelt a miner forty niner, And his daughter Clementine Light she was and like a fairy, And her shoes were number nine, Herring boxes, without topses, Sandals were for Clementine. Clementine! Clementine! Oh my darling, Clementine! Drove she ducklings to the water Every morn just at nine, Hit her foot against a splinter, Fell into the foaming brine. Ruby lips above the water, Blowing bubbles, soft and fine, But, alas, I was no swimmer, So I lost my Clementine. Clementine! Clementine! Oh my darling, Clementine! And the minor forty niner Soon began to peak and pine Thought he oughta join his daughter Now he's left with Clementine In my dreams she still upon me Broken garments soaked in brine Though in life I used to hug her, In death I draw the line Clementine! Clementine! Oh my darling, Clementine! (Oh my darling, oh my darling) How I missed her! How I missed her, How I missed my Clementine, So I kissed her little sister, And I forgot my Clementine.

      "\"Grandpa, here's your coffee,\" Said Edith, as she filled his cup. \"Nobody'll find you here, And Earl is glad you guys showed up.\" \"The way things are downtown, You might have to stay for awhile. There was a helicopter hovering over your house When I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.\" \"Who the hell do they think they are, Invading our home like that? Grandma and I had to leave so fast, We couldn't even catch the cat.\" \"The helicopter scared the shit out of him, And it took off down a trail, Down past the railroad track, Towards the county jail.\" \"Jed, you really screwed up now! What did you have to do that for? Everybody wants to hang your ass, And here's a note from Lenore.\" Sun touched the cold steel bars As she pushed the paper in. Jed took it up and read it And he couldn't hide a grin. Outside the jail window A crow flew across the sky, Completely disappearing behind each bar, Then a helicopter flew by. \"Say hi to Earl and Edith. Tell 'm I'm doing fine. Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now, They should cut the line.\" \"Can grandma come and see me? I got a new song to sing It's longer than all the others combined And it doesn't mean a thing.\" The noise was unfamiliar, Generators whirling, Walkie-talkies screaming, Vans parked in the open field. TV crews and cameras, They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch. They came through the gate and across the lawn Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch. And grandpa saw them there, Looking through the venetian blind. \"Those people don't have any respect, So they won't get any of mine.\" \"I don't wanna talk about Jed. I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9. I don't have time to talk that fast, And it ain't my crime.\" \"It ain't a privilege to be on TV And it ain't a duty either. The only good thing about TV Is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'\" \"'Shows with love and affection', Like mama used to say. A little Mayberry living Could go a long way.\" He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet, Loaded up both barrels. Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off, And up walked a woman named Carol. \"Susan Carol from Early Magazine, I got some questions to ask.\" \"Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!\" Grandpa said with a gasp. Then he fell face first and let out a sigh, And Edith ran out in shock. He was looking at her from down on the floor, Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk. \"That guy just keeps singin'! Can somebody shut him up? I don't know for the life of me Where he comes up with that stuff.\" They laid his head on a newspaper With a picture of Carmichael on the front page, Posing with the little league baseball team, And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle. Grandpa died a hero. Trying to stop the media. Fighting for freedom of silence. Trying to be anonymous. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long. Live so long.    0.246619\n",
      "Where has all that Rock'n'roll gone Oh won't somebody tell me where?

Everything has got to keep changing I know it has to be that way But isn't it too high a price we're paying We're losing most of yesterday And it just don't feel right to me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.245621\n"

And nobody else's hand will ever do Nobody else will do Then I awoke Was this some kind of joke Much to my surprise I opened my eyes. We walked across the sand and the sea and The sky and the castles were blue. I stood and held your hand. And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by I stood and held your hand. And nobody else's hand will ever do Nobody else will do Then I awoke Was this some kind of joke Much to my surprise When I opened my eyes. We heard the trumpets blow and the sky Turned red when I accidently said That I didn't know how I came to be here Not fast asleep in bed. I stood and held your hand. And nobody else's hand will ever do Nobody else's hand Then I awoke Was this some kind of joke I opened my eyes. Much to my surprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.299629\n"

    "Overall, the dataset cooperated with tf-idf better than Bag of Words. What may be deciphered from this practice is that these artists sing about similar subjects and the model had a difficult time classifying who sand what. This was evident in the Latent Semantic Analysis where the components were almost all related to love. Next time around, it might be better to use a sample of different artists. Clustering also proved to be ineffective in classifying artists and only returned one cluster when using mean-shift.\n",

    "Logistic Regression on the TF-IDF model was the most accurate model at 22%. Random Forest had extremely inaccurate models both for BoW and TF-idf only returning accuracies of around 5%. \n",
    "\n",
    "BoW and TF-idf operated very differently in accurately predicitng artists. The top artist in nearly all the Tf-idf model was The Rolling Stones and the BoW models were better at predicting Loretta Lynn and George Strait. Perhaps the penalization strategy of tf-idf has a significantly different effect compared to BoW."
